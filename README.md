# BadCelebBotAzureFunction_v2.1

**March 2022**

1) NEW! Azure Function (python) - just a pure function, no Selenium (thus, no custom Docker container)
2) Custom written python scripts that create a new last name (randomly combined syllables from a spreadsheet), select a celebrity from a spreadsheet, craft a Tweet, and posts a Tweet giving the celeb's "real name" and tagging them
3) Of course, the "real name" is a bogus and ridiculous concoction - but that's the point, isn't it? (Also the main point = creating an Azure Function running on a timer trigger, learn Twitter API stuff with Slack for notifications, and have fun with it)
4) There is one python script missing - the one with the Twitter API keys & my Slack hook. Obviously that's intentional (if it's not obvious, that's on you, not me) 
5) I build and push the Function in VS Code and deploy straight from there

6) Let's not forget some of these spectacularly clunky python scripts (and one very, **very** mangled class). So, sorry 'bout that, but gotta learn somehow, ya know?
