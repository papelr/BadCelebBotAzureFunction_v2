# BadCelebBotAzureFunction_v2.1 - Second Function TimerTrigger

**March 2022**

1) A new addition to the Bad Celeb Bot! This function fires every half hour during the day
2) Instead of just posting a Tweet to the profile timeline, this Function picks a random celeb and replies to their latest Tweet
3) It uses Tweepy to get the latest Tweet ID, and then replies with their "real name"
4) That's it, that's the Tweet
5) For details, check out the README in the BotBotTimer Function ----
